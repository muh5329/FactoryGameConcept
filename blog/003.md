# Pathfining using A* (A-star) Alogorithm

   This article concerns with using A* as an alternative to recast as a pathfinding algorithm. 


## Why A*?

- Realtively easy to program
- Grid based
- Allows full controll of codebase
- Reasonably fast for small maps and small units 

## What is A* 

First some assumptions. We assume that the world is split into some sort of grid that being the map is split into some sort of 2D walkable grid / navmesh that can be walked over. 

A* is an algorithm that uses three different variables to navigate to its corresponding node:
   - G Cast : Travel distance from node to start node
   - H Cast : Estimated distance from node to the target node . This will either be exact or will underestimate the cost to arrive.  The acctual steps required will be equal or more than the estimated H Cast
   - F : G + H

      [------ distance to G ------]
                  3         [--- distance from H to End ---]
                                          2

The lower the f cost the more attractive this path is as a pathfinding option .

## Setting Up


- Have a general node class
   - Getter setters for connedtion
   - G , H , F=>H+G Floats
   - SetConnection() Function
   - SetG()
   - SetH()

- Find Path Function:
   - Takes in Start node, Target Node
   - Creates list of nodes to search, adds start node
   - creates list of processed nodes
   - Keep Searching until there are nodes to search
      - Amoungts all the currently selected search nodes, find the lowest path 
      - set that as the current
      - add that current node the processed
      - Remove current from search
   - Iterate through all of the current nodes neighbors and do the following:
      - If they are walkable and have not been processed
         - Calculate its new cost to get to the neighboring node
            - current.g + current.GetDistance(neighbor) 
         - Calculate its new G
            - Update the G if the new G is less the neighbors previous g
         - Set its G
            - Distance to Target Node and Neighbor
            - Add to Search List
   - Once current node == TargetNode , return the path


## Optimizations

   - ForEarch loop for finding the best F-cost Nodes
      - Replaced by a binary tree / Heap
