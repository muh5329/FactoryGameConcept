# Pathfining using A* (A-star) Alogorithm and optimizing it

   This article concerns with using A* in a single thread loop synchronously, and its potential performance impact that may have on speed. 


## The problem 

  For one single unit on a small grid the path finding algorithm performs just fine. However, when we ratchet up the number objects having the pathfinding algorithm run on within a single frame, this causes several issues.  We can see in severe cases the program can segmetation fault and straight up crash. 

## Optimizations
